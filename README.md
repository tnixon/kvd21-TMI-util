# kvd21-TMI-util
Simple Python utility to hack / modify configuration of Arcadyan KVD21 router for T-Mobile Home Internet.

Currently, it does 1 thing: disable the built-in WiFi of the unit. There is currently no way to do this via the web UI on the unit.
This is useful for those who wish to use the unit as a backup/failover WAN connection connected to another router, but don't need the unit as a WiFi router itself.

This is based on the method described by Nater Tater on his YouTube video here:
